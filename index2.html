		<h2>Kokology 1 (04/13/16)</h2>
		<h6> April 18, 2016 Monday</h6>
		<p>Question: </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s your birthday today, and when you check your mailbox you see you&rsquo;ve gotten a card from someone you would have never expected. Who is the sender? You have also received a number of gifts from family and friends. Of that group, who sent you the biggest package? (Give the names of people in your life when answering the quiz.)</p>

		<p>Answer:</p>

			<p>1. I expected the sender of the card to be my girlfriend, Nicole, because of the love and care that she has shown to me. It is also because she expresses her feelings better when she writes.</p>

			<p>2. I expected my parents to give me the biggest package on my birthday because, I believe, that my parents are going to be the proudest of all during my birthday and to show how proud they are of me, they will give me a big present.</p> 

		<p>Paragraph:</p>

			<p>It's been a while since I've received any letters from my friends and family. The last one that I got was from my girlfriend when we were just starting to get to know each other.</p>

			<p>The first letter that I got from her was when we got our original copy of our graduation picture. All of my classmates, of course, wanted to get my picture and I wanted to get theirs. The thing with these exchange though is that we had to write short dedication letters at the back of our pictures before we give the pictures to our classmates who ask for them. </p>

			<p> I saw this as a great opportunity to get a letter from her and I first wrote to her a full back-to-back page of yellow pad paper as my dedication. In return, she wrote her dedication for me on a whole sheet of short bond paper. </p>

		<h2>Taken, but for Granted (FGR)</h2>
		<h6>April 19, 2016</h6>
		<p>Have you ever felt that people were just using you because you might be good in your academics or when they need something from you (i.e. your car to go to school, your brains in answering their questions during exams)? The truth about how life works is that when someone really really REALLY likes you, you just DON&rsquo;T give a damn to like them back. I have seen this happen to a lot of people and most especially my family and friends. </p>

		<p>The feeling is, of course, depressing to be in that end of the spectrum&mdash; that is to be the one being used. As I&rsquo;ve answered the second question in our Kokology test&mdash; the one who would bring me a present, I realised that I have taken my parent&rsquo;s love for granted. A realisation that soon changed my views on my parents after the test.</p>

		<p>I always hear my parents say that we, my siblings and I, only talk to them  whenever we are in need of something from them. Be it asking for permission if we could stay over in our friends house to heavier activities going on a road trip with my college blockmates, my parents have always been thinking about my welfare. Why can&rsquo;t I do the same for them?</p>

		<p> It turns out that we humans are hard-wired to take things that we have for granted, especially our parents. Being with us even before we were born to this world, our parents have made a huge impact on our lives&mdash; some even form their lives and future plans through them, yet we tend to ignore their efforts and focus on our own little lives.</p>

		<p> As a pure Chinese-blooded individual, my parents raised me to be the person that they want for them to succeed in our business. They urged me to be good, no better in my Math and Science subjects; to lead in various activities like projects and events; to be more vocal so that I will be able to talk to random strangers; and most especially to take on a "Management" course in this prestigious school.</p>

		<p> Of course my initial answer would be, NO! Not because I didn&rsquo;t like studying for Math and Science, or I didn&rsquo;t like taking responsibilities for a project or even destroy my life by taking on a "Management" course, I said NO because I wanted to dictate my own life and I felt like the whole tradition of doing business is chocking me. Why can&rsquo;t they let me be&mdash; a young millennial living his life for the sake of LIVING. </p>

		<p> I pursued my own course&mdash; Computer Science. I (kinda) flunked in my Science classes. I&rsquo;m struggling to be a project head in my stay in this school as of now. My parents sometimes don&rsquo;t even give a damn on what I do in school anymore. They ask occasionally for anything new that has happened in my life recently, but I think that I&rsquo;ve lost their patience toward me. I feel as though I am a bad child by not following my parents, but I can change for the good after this realisation. I still have time to redeem myself from my mistakes and improve my relationships with my parents. I still have hope. </p>

		<p> I think the biggest takeaway from all of this is that we should never take our parents for granted. Not because it is morally incorrect, but because they are there to support us and to guide us in everything that we do. They know what's best for us, more than we know ourselves. Yes, they might be taken. Taken in a sense that they long for a mutual relationship between us (their children) and them. Taken in a way that they offer themselves wholeheartedly to help us grow in the right manners. That is why we shouldn&rsquo;t put all their hardwork aside. We shouldn&rsquo;t think only about ourselves because they think about us and we SHOULD NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. </p>

		<h2>Kokology 2 (04/18/16)</h2>
		<h6> April 24, 2016 </h6>
		<p>Question: </p>
			<p>1. Inside the candy store, you find rows and rows of the old familiar candies, chocolate bars, chewing gums, and sweets from your youth. Some are stacked in organized shelves, some are loose in baskets and jars. What candy do you pick first, and why did you choose it? (Give the full reason behind your choice.)</p>

			<p>2. While you're wandering the store making selections, you notice that outside a group of children look as though they're getting ready to enter the store. How many children actually come in?</p>

			<p>3. You make your purchases and go home with a bag of candy. But when you open the bag, you see that the shopkeeper has added some free extra candies as a special treat for you. How many extras did you get?</p>

			<p>4. You've been thinking about giving the candy you bought as a gift to someone. To whom, if anyone, would you give it?</p>

		<p>Answer:</p>
			<p>1. I will pick white rabbit. White rabbit is one of my favorite candies and one of the first I&rsquo;ve ever tried. It also brings a milky sensation unto my mouth.</p>

			<p>2. I saw three children that entered the candy store.</p>

			<p>3. I got three extra candies from the shopkeeper.</p>

			<p>4. I would give it to my friends who want candies, for example, Miguel.</p>

		<p>Paragraph:</p>
			<p>The White Rabbit candy brings a nostalgic feeling of my childhood that I will never be able to bring back anymore. Choosing from the choices provided by our professor, I chose to focus my whole lot of history in describing my attention/ affection seeking self.</p>

			<p>It was the summer after my second year in high school. This was the time when I got to go to malls on a daily basis with my friends. The thing was, right after we had our training in swimming, we would go to Lucky Chinatown Mall, a mall near our house, and spend the whole afternoon just wasting money doing whatever. My parents would always ask why I always go to the mall with my friends despite me having a difficult time in having money on our outings. I couldn&rsquo;t answer them at first, but now, I feel like the answer is simple. I needed attention. I needed affection</p>

			<p>Growing up in a family of four siblings, me being the last, I felt like I wanted the attention to be focused on me just as what any other &rsquo;bunso&rsquo; in the family would want. I never had that, instead, all I got were nags and lessons whenever I do something wrong. That is why I continue to do the things that make them feel bad about me because that is the only way I can get their attention.</p>

		<h2>The Bully (FGR)</h2>
		<h6>April 24, 2016</h6>
		<p>I've always been considered a bully by my friends and I didn&rsquo;t know why. Maybe it&rsquo;s something about my personality or my childhood. You see, I&rsquo;ve been neglected as a child. Neglected by my parents who I looked up to for advice. Neglected by my friends who used me for the things that they wanted from me. Neglected by myself because I kept masking my true feelings away from the people I cared about.</p>

		<p>It all started when I was in grade school. I try to behave the best way I can in front of other people, but sadly, I could only do that to people much older than I am. I ask myself every night as I go to sleep whether or not I have real friends&mdash; friends who ask me what my problems are whenever I feel down; friends who listen to me whenever I rant about my problems; friends who are just there to support me in any way that they can despite me sometimes being a jerk to them. I bullied people. Not because I wanted to, but because I felt the need to be recognized&mdash; I wanted attention.</p>

		<p>I remembered making a lot of students cry when I was young. My classmates who always think of me as a bad guy would sometimes still take my side because they were afraid of being bullied. I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone though, it's just that I like the feeling of being noticed by other people. I wanted the attention they gave me that I couldn&rsquo;t get from the people I loved. I was the attention-seeking jerk in the school that is always getting punished by the teachers.</p>

		<p>My parents would always receive letters from my school because of my poor behavior in all my classes, and I think that was the time that they really tried to start noticing me, but I took it all for granted. I wanted their attention for so long, but after getting them, I felt like it wasn&rsquo;t effective anymore. I started to care less about how they tried to mingle and talk to me after school because I have grown accustomed to not talking to them about it when I was younger. I think that was the greatest mistake of my life&mdash; to take the things or people I have for granted.</p>

		<p>Years passed and I&rsquo;ve eventually surpassed those moments of being a bully. I learned through the years that I am better than I was although it has already been a part of my personality whilst growing accustomed to the people I know. Wanting attention was not my go-to thing anymore. I have also grown to understand my parents more and communicate with them more. I became a better man. Although I have learned my lessons of being a bully to everyone and tried to change myself for the better, I still ask my newer friends whether or not the feel like I am a bully to them, and the answer I hear from them? Yes.</p>

		<h2>Kokology 3</h2>
		<h6>May 3, 2016 Tuesday</h6>
		<p>Question: </p>
			<p>1. You are in an old, abandoned building where no human has set foot for years and have discovered a staircase leading underground. Slowly you make your way down, conunting the steps as you go. One step ... two ... three ... How many steps is it to the bottom of the stairs?</p>

			<p>2. The underground room is pitch black. Then, from the darkness you hear the sound of another person. Is the person weeping softly? Moeaning wordlessly? Is it a voice speaking to you?</p>

			<p>3. How do you react on hearing the sound of this other person? Do you try to search out the source? Is your first instinct to run up the stairs without looking back? Or are you paralyzed with fear and frozen where you stand?</p>

			<p>4. You hear a person now calling your name and see a figure descending from the light at the top of the stairs. Who is this person coming down the stairs?</p>

		<p>Answer:</p>
			<p>1. 10 steps to the bottom of the stairs.</p>
			<p>2. Moaning Wordlessly</p>
			<p>3. Try to search out the source</p>
			<p>4. A stranger (policeman)</p>

		<p>Paragraph:</p>
			<p>As the youngest member of my family, I was often treated as the supposed &rsquo;baby&rsquo;. Everytime I would do something or decide on something, my parents would always think twice about it. Sad as it may seem, I feel like my childhood was always centered around my parent&rsquo;s decisions.</p>

			<p>I was dependent and I am proud of it. My dependence on my parents gave me the independence that I have obtained right now and because of this, I am now able to decide on my own. I now start to tackle my problems head-on, not afraid of the consequences that it would bring afterwards.</p>

			<p>The answers to the kokology question enlightened me on some points that I felt impossible in me. I realized that I am more than what I seem and it&rsquo;s my past that influences who I am today.</p>

			<p>The ten steps to the bottom of the staircase symbolizes the scale of my dependence with my parents, and I am proud to have answered only a few steps over the average. My answer shows that my independence with my parents have lessened over the couple of years. </p>

		<h2>My First Love (FGR)</h2>
		<h6>May 5, 2016</h6>
		<p>It has been a good four years since I've said my first &rsquo;I Love You&rsquo; to the person I thought I would be spending my whole life with. A hole in my heart forged from the fizzle of the love reciprocated in the form of text messages. A love, pure in its best of sense, stained by the realities that was hidden in the heat and passion of the relationship. It would have been the best experience of my life &mdash; having been able to successfully steal the heart of my first love.</p>

		<p>My first love came in the most unexpected manner in the form of a book. It was funny how her friends described it &mdash; a love story they said. It all started the summer after my first year in high school while we were in the swimming pool during our varsity training. I have admired her from a distnace for a time now, and have always been thinking about talking to her. My shyness overpowered me, of course. I could not even look at her in the eyes.</p>

		<p>Everything changed after that training, however. It was at this time that the book that brought us together came into play. Her sister was an incoming freshman and she had to borrow books in order for her sister to not waste more money in investing on the book. Unfortunately, the book she wanted was an Algebra book that my sister was keeping because of personal reasons. I told her that I&rsquo;ll try to borrow it from my sister if she allows me, and I made it so that I will often delay the times I will question my sister in order for us, my &rsquo;love&rsquo;, to spend a little more time as she bugs me for the book she wanted to borrow.</p>

		<p>My delaying tactics in letting her borrow the book worked, however, as she and I became closer after a month. I was getting more and more attracted to her as time passed and I didn&rsquo;t know if she was feeling the same way for me. I was scared to confront her on how I felt over the past month. Eventually, months have passed and we&rsquo;ve continued to talk with each other, each day strengthening our relationship further.</p>

		<p>Three months in on our friendship, I&rsquo;ve decided to take the next step by confronting her about my feelings towards her. Funny as it sounds, I confronted my feelings in the form of a text message and it felt great as she told me that she liked me too.</p>

		<p>Looking back, I felt a sense of achievement and disappointment within myself. An achievement because it was my first real relationship and I am proud to have step out of my comfort zone in confronting my feelings towards the girl that I liked, but also a disappointment in myself as I look back. Disappointed that I confronted my feelings for her through a text message.</p>

		<h2>Kokology 4</h2>
		<h6>May 10, 2016 Tuesday</h6>
		<p>Question: </p>
			<p>You are staying at a resort hotel with an ocean view. Lying on your bed, you gaze out a huge bay window across the cool blue waters, and lulled by the scene, you drift off to sleep. Which of the following views greets you when you awake?</p>

		<p>Answer:</p>
			<p>A Bright midday sun burning over the sea</p>

		<p>Paragraph:</p>
			<p>Our last kokology activity seemed pretty interesting as it talked about love. An interesting activity for those who seek to understand themselves in the context of love, I found myself intrigued with the results of the activity. It turns out that my answer for the activity best resembled me as an individual that is passionate about love.</p>

			<p>The ideal relationship I seek is where there is passion, excitement, and intensity in love. Lacking one of those would suggest something that is not true love for me. Honestly, I can say, that is correct.</p>

			<p>Currently on my second year in a relationship with my girlfriend, love was not how it was back in the days. For me, a person needs to cover two steps &mdash; puppy love and mature love, in order to master the art of truly loving someone.</p>

			<p>The puppy love stage is a popular stage amongst teenagers as the heat and passion of &rsquo;love&rsquo; tend to run through the veins of couples. In a similar case, I met my current girlfriend during our fourth year in high school and I will admit that was puppy love. We did not truly understand the meaning of love as we sought to only fulfill our inner desires through the use of one another, well mostly me. To satisfy my guilty pleasures, I had the urge to want to meet with her every single day and whenever that plan does not work, I would get angry and sometimes feel so disappointed. I had thought that she did not love me because she did not want to see me, little did I know, I was wrong.</p>

			<p>To survive the puppy love stage, I would have to go through the &rsquo;Surviving-the-problems Stage&rsquo;. It is self-explanatory, however, I think it is the hardest part in a relationship. Going through the imperfections as you see past the perfections that both of you placed on each other, the road to a mature love needs to look past the physical attractions that you have with your significant other, and I saw past that. We overcame our struggles, even though it was hard. Talking, communicating, and listening to each other, we were dedicated in solving our problems in the relationship to secure a brighter and stronger relationship ahead.</p>
