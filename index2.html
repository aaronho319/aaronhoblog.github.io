		<h2>Kokology 1 (04/13/16)</h2>
		<h6> April 18, 2016 Monday</h6>
		<p>Question: </p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s your birthday today, and when you check your mailbox you see you&rsquo;ve gotten a card from someone you would have never expected. Who is the sender? You have also received a number of gifts from family and friends. Of that group, who sent you the biggest package? (Give the names of people in your life when answering the quiz.)</p>

		<p>Answer:</p>

			<p>1. I expected the sender of the card to be my girlfriend, Nicole, because of the love and care that she has shown to me. It is also because she expresses her feelings better when she writes.</p>

			<p>2. I expected my parents to give me the biggest package on my birthday because, I believe, that my parents are going to be the proudest of all during my birthday and to show how proud they are of me, they will give me a big present.</p> 

		<p>Paragraph:</p>

			<p>It's been a while since I've received any letters from my friends and family. The last one that I got was from my girlfriend when we were just starting to get to know each other.</p>

			<p>The first letter that I got from her was when we got our original copy of our graduation picture. All of my classmates, of course, wanted to get my picture and I wanted to get theirs. The thing with these exchange though is that we had to write short dedication letters at the back of our pictures before we give the pictures to our classmates who ask for them. </p>

			<p> I saw this as a great opportunity to get a letter from her and I first wrote to her a full back-to-back page of yellow pad paper as my dedication. In return, she wrote her dedication for me on a whole sheet of short bond paper. </p>

		<h2>Taken, but for Granted (FGR)</h2>
		<h6>April 19, 2016</h6>
		<p>Have you ever felt that people were just using you because you might be good in your academics or when they need something from you (i.e. your car to go to school, your brains in answering their questions during exams)? The truth about how life works is that when someone really really REALLY likes you, you just DON&rsquo;T give a damn to like them back. I have seen this happen to a lot of people and most especially my family and friends. </p>

		<p>The feeling is, of course, depressing to be in that end of the spectrum&mdash; that is to be the one being used. As I&rsquo;ve answered the second question in our Kokology test&mdash; the one who would bring me a present, I realised that I have taken my parent&rsquo;s love for granted. A realisation that soon changed my views on my parents after the test.</p>

		<p>I always hear my parents say that we, my siblings and I, only talk to them  whenever we are in need of something from them. Be it asking for permission if we could stay over in our friends house to heavier activities going on a road trip with my college blockmates, my parents have always been thinking about my welfare. Why can&rsquo;t I do the same for them?</p>

		<p> It turns out that we humans are hard-wired to take things that we have for granted, especially our parents. Being with us even before we were born to this world, our parents have made a huge impact on our lives&mdash; some even form their lives and future plans through them, yet we tend to ignore their efforts and focus on our own little lives.</p>

		<p> As a pure Chinese-blooded individual, my parents raised me to be the person that they want for them to succeed in our business. They urged me to be good, no better in my Math and Science subjects; to lead in various activities like projects and events; to be more vocal so that I will be able to talk to random strangers; and most especially to take on a "Management" course in this prestigious school.</p>

		<p> Of course my initial answer would be, NO! Not because I didn&rsquo;t like studying for Math and Science, or I didn&rsquo;t like taking responsibilities for a project or even destroy my life by taking on a "Management" course. I said NO because I wanted to dictate my own life and I felt like the whole tradition of doing business is choking me. Why can&rsquo;t they let me be&mdash; a young millennial living his life for the sake of LIVING. </p>

		<p> I pursued my own course&mdash; Computer Science. I (kinda) flunked in my Science classes. I&rsquo;m struggling to be a project head in my stay in this school as of now. My parents sometimes don&rsquo;t even give a damn on what I do in school anymore. They ask occasionally for anything new that has happened in my life recently, but I think that I&rsquo;ve lost their patience toward me. I feel as though I am a bad child by not following my parents, but I can change for the good after this realisation. I still have time to redeem myself from my mistakes and improve my relationships with my parents. I still have hope. </p>

		<p> I think the biggest takeaway from all of this is that we should never take our parents for granted. Not because it is morally incorrect, but because they are there to support us and to guide us in everything that we do. They know what's best for us, more than we know ourselves. Yes, they might be taken. Taken in a sense that they long for a mutual relationship between us (their children) and them. Taken in a way that they offer themselves wholeheartedly to help us grow in the right manners. That is why we shouldn&rsquo;t put all their hardwork aside. We shouldn&rsquo;t think only about ourselves because they think about us and we SHOULD NOT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. </p>
